      PURPOSE: Class for a NeutReflect generalized particle
               source.  This source in its first encarnation is copied 
	       from the /cdmsim/Gopher/ particle source.  The main
	       goal of the source is to make generation of contamination
	       easier and have it done more quickly so that studies of
	       low background counting can easily be accomplished.
